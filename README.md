## Prerequisites

To run Universal Downloader, youâ€™ll need:

- Python 3.7+

- ffmpeg and ffprobe: Required for video processing and codec conversion.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Iosif-Christogeorgos/UniversalDownloader.git
```

```
cd universal-downloader
```

2. Install dependencies: Install the necessary packages from requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download ffmpeg and ffprobe:

- Visit the [FFmpeg download page](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) to download the latest version.

- Extract the downloaded folder, and copy ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe to the same directory as main.py.

## Usage

1. Run the application:

```
python main.py

## Example Use Case

If a video is not already in the H.264 codec, the app will automatically convert it upon download, ensuring compatibility with most players.

## Files Overview

**main.py**: The main script for running the application.

**YTDLPLogger.py**: Logger for tracking download progress.

**requirements.txt**: Lists required Python packages.

**ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe**: Place these files in the project root for video processing (required but not included in the repository).

## Dependencies

**yt-dlp**: For video and audio downloading.

**customtkinter**: For the graphical user interface.

**tkinter**: Core library for UI elements (comes with Python).

**ffmpeg and ffprobe**: For handling video codec conversion and metadata extraction.

## Notes

- **Codec Conversion**: The application checks if the downloaded video is in H.264 format. If not, it converts it automatically.
